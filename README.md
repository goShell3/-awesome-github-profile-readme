## üöÄ About Me

Hi, I'm a learner at the **ALX Software Engineering Program** specializing in **Backend Development**. I began my journey in software engineering driven by curiosity and the desire to understand how systems work. Over time, that curiosity has grown into a passion for **designing secure, scalable, and intelligent backend systems** that address real-world problems ‚Äî especially in Africa.

üí° I'm inspired by the **power of tech to create social impact**, and I strongly believe in building ethical, accessible, and community-driven solutions.
